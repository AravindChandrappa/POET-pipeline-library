/**
 * Implements branch condition tests for conditional execution of pipeline steps.
 *
 * A branch condition can take:
 *   - a single value or pattern
 *   - a list of values or patterns
 *   - a map with elements `include` and `exclude`, each of which can take a single value or list.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Execute a step if the branch is on master or release:
 *
 * branch: [master, release]
 *
 * Execute a step if the branch starts with feature/*
 *
 * branch: feature/*
 *
 * Execute a step using include and exclude logic:
 *
 * branch:
 *   include: [ master, feature/* ]
 *   exclude: [ feature/something, feature/old_thing* ]
 *
 * Patterns:
 * We implement simple pattern matching, and can match against the following styles:
 * xxx*, *xxx, *xxx*, and xxx*yyy, with an arbitrary number of pattern parts, as well as direct matches.
 *
 * @see PatternMatchUtils
